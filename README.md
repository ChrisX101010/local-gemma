Alternativelly, you can also install on your Python environment through

```
pip install local-gemma-2
```

## Usage

You can chat with the model through an interactive session by calling

```
local-gemma-2
```

Alternativelly, you can request an output by passing the prompt, such as

```

```

Depending on your device and setup, a few optimizations will be automatically enabled (e.g. Flash Attention). You can select different types of optimization through the `--optimization` flag, e.g. `memory` for GPU memory constrained situations. You can also control the style of the generated text through the `--mode` flag, e.g. `factual` to minimize halluciations. Here's an example:

```
local-gemma-2 --optimization memory --mode creative
```

Call `local-gemma-2 -h` for all available options.
